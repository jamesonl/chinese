Where I store all the words I learn from books, movies, and lessons that I read / watch.

## A Workflow for Flashcards

Here is a list of the steps I often find myself repeating:
 1. Read / source material to study a language (so far, this is only Mandarin)
 2. Reference a translation website
    - These translations aren't always contextually correct
    - I may not know how to properly write the mandarin character, so this could take some time
 3. Write the translation info (word, pinyin, definition) down somewhere
 4. Capture some kind of sentence example
 5. Manually add to flashcard apps
 6. Review

This cycle **takes a really long time!**

I am going to store ALL of the words and concepts that I learn in a json format. This means that I should be able to later reference these variables in order to review in a flashcard format at some point in the future.

## Format for Documentation

[中文] - [pinyin] - [definition]

## Python

There are a variety of integrations that I want to credit:
